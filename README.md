I designed Caranology to help users ask and answer car-related questions with ease. Users can create, manage, and view questions, as well as upvote or 
downvote answers. Although I built a login and sign-up system, I currently donâ€™t have a database to store user information. To keep things running smoothly,
I added a link on the login page that lets users access the main features directly. The site is fully functional and ready for deployment, but it will need
data storage integration to support user accounts and persistence.
